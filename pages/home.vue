              Strong and creative communications professional with a Ba in
              Communication Management and a fingerspitzengef√ºhl for Lay-Out and
              Graphic Design... that's German for being damn good. I am Daan,
              born in '98 and ready for some hands-on experience in
              communications! I love creating content from scratch that is
              simple, efficient, and easy-going. Oh and it has to look nice as
              well, that's a must. For my design work, I let myself inspire by
              my surroundings, how absurd they may be. I am an observer, and
              that helps. I see opportunities, not problems.
